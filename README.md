# Css to Sass 
### "All Nations University College" - top portion of website

*Oct 5, 2020*

Website was not my work but instead **re-structured** to be `Sass` rather than basic `Css`.

**TO RUN**

Simply open the `index.html` in any modern web browser.


### Reason for Application
This project was designed for **Interactive Media Design** at **Fanshawe College**

Purpose was to demonstrate basic knowledge of Sass.
