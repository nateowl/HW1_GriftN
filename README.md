# Css to Sass & Dynamic Content
### "All Nations University College" - top portion of website

*Oct 16, 2020*

Website was not my work but instead **re-structured** to be `Sass` rather than basic `Css`.  Dynamic content was added with the fetch api from `classData.json`.  

**TO RUN**

Simply run `index.html` on a live server.  Will NOT run if you simply open `index.html` as a document in browser.


### Reason for Application
This project was designed for **Interactive Media Design** at **Fanshawe College**

Purpose was to demonstrate basic knowledge of Sass and AJAX
